Hi my name is Chuqiao Lu, a third year student majored in EE from ERC.
This is my first README.md file I created in ECE140A.

this assignment just walk us recall back something about python and learn new things on creating a website by html.

In the python tutorial,  I recall back to the previous learning experience of C++. this two programming languages have lots of properties in common but they do differs a lot also. For example, in C++, I should say"for(int i=0,i<10,i++){then do something}", but in python, I can just barely says if i in range(0,9), which is just the same as it in c++. Python is much simpler.

In web tutorial, we are given the guidance of how to creat a server by using fastAPI(my choice) In which we are using our laptop as a server. When we want to access the local homepage 6543, the web will send a request to server and server will given the corresponding HTML file which has my own things written down. I also learned how to add a static picture into the server to make it displayed on webpage.

for challenge 1, I would say it is too difficult as the homework1, in which we write some functions to do some certain tasks. I surprisingly found there is one which want us to count how many letters occur in a string. It is just like one of the assignment in ECE17. I can't believe ECE140A just put this in the very first homework. So I feel a little bit nervous about the other homework's difficulty

the challenge 2 are more friendly, the knowledges learned from tutorial of web serving is enough for this part. I just entered my profolio in the HTMl code and added my thingking about three projects I have took. It is much simpler, don't need much skills or thinking.
