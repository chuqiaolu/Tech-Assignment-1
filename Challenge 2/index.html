    <h2>Project1: Boomerang flying trajectory</h2>
    <div>research on boomerang using UWB. 3monthes(ongoing). Now my
      duty is to ramp up with the progresses that previous students have done on
      using UWB chips to locate boomerang. I think this project is pretty meanningful
      because it combines ECE and MAE knowledges and it provide me a good cooperating enviroment
      I like it so much!

    <h2>Project2: pattern recognition car</h2>
    <div>in ECE5, we create a small car using 3D printing, embeded system, PCb design, and 
      circuit fdundamentals to make a auto car that could read the pattern on a white background and 
      follow the lines which is in black. This project is good because it acts like the introduction to 
      ECE world and attach my attention.

    <h2>Project3: rain detector</h2>
    <div> by using a adafruit board and circuit python. I creat a small device which is called 
      rain detector. As long as there are water drops on the chip. The motor on it will rotate and ring to 
      signify there are raining. This project is totally done by myself and it is the first time I got experience
      to design and implement some electronic devices on myself.
